# Apple Site Mock-Up
A fake mock-up created based on an Apple Site page. It's to show how recreation from a wireframe is possible--and easy! There is no functionality to this page... purely done to show capability. There are images referenced in this code that are in the folder I have uploaded for the live site--but omitted for GitHub as they, obviously, don't show code.
